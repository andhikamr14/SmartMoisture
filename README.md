# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-SMALL-SCALE-OF-INDUSTRIAL-TECHNOLOGY-4.0-BASED-ON-INTERNET-OF-THINGS-(IOT)-TO-EASY-THE-STANDARDIZATION-OF-WATER-CONTENTS-IN-PRINTED-SAND
The world of the foundry industry is very difficult to adjust to industrial technology 4.0 because the process is very complex and on average it still requires man power (Manual). We are making small-scale innovations to apply the Internet of Things to our metal casting field to make simple improvements that can solve problems.
In the world of metal casting, sand is one of the vital components to produce a good casting product. Printed sand has several types, one of which is greensand sand, this greensand sand has a mixture of new silica sand, used silica sand, bentonite, seacoal / coaldust, and water. In small and medium-sized industries the use of water used is often not according to standards resulting in failed products, the cause of the company not using water according to the standard because machine tools know the water content in the cashier is expensive and requires a long processing time.
